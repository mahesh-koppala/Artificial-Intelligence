Explanation:

The Evaluation function calculates the the number of consecutive four's, three's and two's for both player and computer in the gameboard. 
This is done using checking the gameboard vertically, horizontally and diagonally. 
Each of these consecutive occurances are multiplied by weights such that the maximum possible outcome of consecutive two's should be less than the consecutive three's and 
maximum consecutive three's should be less than those of consecutive four's.
The sum of the above occurances multiplied by weights for player are then subtracted by those of the computer and the best move is chosen.
